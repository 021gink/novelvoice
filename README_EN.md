### Author's Recommendation: Speech Engine Selection Guide

Based on practical usage experience, we provide the following engine selection recommendations:

#### ü•á **Top Recommendation: XTTS v2**
- **Advantages**: Excellent speech quality, fast synthesis speed, supports multiple languages
- **Use Cases**: Most novel conversion scenarios, especially batch processing of long novels
- **Features**: Balances quality and speed, best overall performance

#### ü•à **Second Choice: ChatTTS**
- **Advantages**: Supports random multiple voices, rich emotional expression
- **Use Cases**: Dialogue-heavy novels, scenarios requiring diverse voice tones
- **Special Use**: Generated WAV audio can be used as clone voice source for XTTS and CosyVoice

#### ü•â **Specific Scenario: CosyVoice**
- **Advantages**: Highest speech quality, supports zero-shot voice cloning
- **Use Cases**: Short text scenarios with extremely high quality requirements
- **Note**: Slowest synthesis speed, not recommended for batch processing of long novels

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not Recommended: Kokoro**
- **Reason**: Limited quality of fine-tuned model PT voice files
- **Features**: Although fastest in synthesis speed, quality cannot meet novel conversion requirements

**Overall Ranking**: XTTS > ChatTTS > CosyVoice > Kokoro  
(Balance of quality & speed > Voice diversity > Ultimate quality > Fastest speed)
